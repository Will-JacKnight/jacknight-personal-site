            "content_html": "<p>As a part of a new series, I&#39;ll try to piece together my recent readings and findings. Some of which are pieces that I&#39;ve heard brillient people talking that makes me reflect deeper into myself. I&#39;ll post them here, for my personal reminder, also for your encouragement.</p>\n<p>Need to mention, some or most of them are just opinions, not facts. There&#39;s no certain path to follow, if it does exist, follow what leads your heart.</p>\n<h2>Keep the momentum.</h2>\n<p>This was brought up in a social event after weeks of exams. By context, it refers to the fact that one shouldn&#39;t let go of the state of mental fulfillness and keep things undergoing. Personally, I think it&#39;s also about building a life cycle with consistent dedication to tasks and focus that runs automatically. Conversively, eating cold served food, may not be a good ieda.</p>\n<h2>Two way doors.</h2>\n<p>It&#39;s one of Amazon&#39;s Leadership Principles that some of us shared concensus. It basically refers a situation where one&#39;s stuck with the decision whether to move forward and being indecisive. By two way doors, it means always trying the other option when there is. If it fails, just naturally falls back to where one left off. </p>\n<p>I recalled this not because it&#39;s anything new, but mostly as a reminder for myself that I should at least try options before landing myself in any position, comfortable or not. And that this idea of evolution should be embedded in our daily process.</p>\n<h2>Keep chasing novelty with performance</h2>\n<p>The thing is it&#39;s way easier to get stuck in a field, only worrying about what&#39;s happening around. One can be a excellent fish hunter after generations of hunting in the north Atalantic, yet he&#39;s never had any experience of riding camels in a desert. Life is not just about persuing absolute excellence in one area, but also in the joy of discovering diverse experience in the vast world. Trying new combinations may somehow lead to unexpected results.</p>\n<p>Nolvelty is a sense of interestingness increment. Go explore the unknown part of the chart my friend.</p>\n<p>To conclude, there&#39;re some pictures taken recently at the Seven Sisters Cliff. Nicely weather, calming views, friendly neighbourhood, curious seegulls (trying to share our fish &amp; chips). If anyone&#39;s interested in going to Briton, you should try this place named Pinocchio, they&#39;ve got the best Italian food(Personally).</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/posts/weekly1/cliff1.jpg\" alt=\"Seven Sisters Cliff | Seven Sisters Cliff\">\n<img src=\"images/posts/weekly1/cliff2.jpg\" alt=\"Seaford Cliff| Seaford Cliff\">\n<img src=\"images/posts/weekly1/beach1.jpg\" alt=\"Seaford Shore | Seaford Shore\">\n<img src=\"images/posts/weekly1/beach2.jpg\" alt=\"Seaford Beach | Seaford Beach\"></p>\n",

It is not until the emergence of AI tools and some undertaken software development experience that makes this possible.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you will have this feeling that some ideas have to get out, whether it&#39;s in the shower or some small talks with friends, and it is quite a pity that without recording, they&#39;re very easy to flee away. </p>\n<p>In the days to come, I will keep updating this blog with my best ability, to capture these ideas. Hopefully, my readers, you can find this journey worthwhile.</p>\n<p>You&#39;re always welcome to drop me an <a href=\"mailto:wang.jiankai@outlook.com\">email</a>.</p>\n<h3>About the Main Page Images</h3>\n<p>The moss picture was taken on my last journey to Saihoji Garden in August 2024. It was a secret trip meant to get away from the normal life. All efforts paid off when reaching the temple. The tranquility and zen are beyond words.</p>\n<p>You see the nature, you see the nurturance, you see momentum.</p>\n<p>You discover deeper in yourself.</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/posts/intro/saihoji-monk.JPG\" alt=\"saihoji monk|saihoji monk, photographed in Aug, 2024\">\n<img src=\"images/posts/intro/saihoji-garden.jpg\" alt=\"saihoji moss garden|saihoji moss garden, photographed in Aug, 2024\"></p>\n",
