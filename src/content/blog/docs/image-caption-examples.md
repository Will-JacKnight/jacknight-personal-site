# Using Image Captions

This post demonstrates different ways to use image captions in your markdown content.

## Standard Image without Caption

Using standard markdown image syntax without a caption:

## Image with Caption

Adding a caption by using the pipe syntax in the alt text:

## Image with Longer Caption

Captions can be as long as needed:

This particular mountain range is known for its dramatic formations and changing colors throughout the seasons.](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1454496522488-7a8e488e8606?w=800&auto=format&fit=crop)

## Formatting in Alt Text vs. Caption

The part before the pipe (`|`) is the alt text used for accessibility, while the part after is the visible caption:

![Waves crashing on rocks (this is the alt text) | This is the visible caption showing ocean waves hitting coastal rocks](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518803194621-27188ba362c9?w=800&auto=format&fit=crop)

## Local Images with Captions

Captions also work with local images in your project:

## Using HTML Entities in Captions

You can use HTML entities in captions if needed:

## Design Considerations

When using captions, consider:

1. Keep alt text concise but descriptive for accessibility
2. Use captions to provide additional context or attribution
3. Captions are styled to be visually distinct from the main content
4. All images are responsive and will adjust to different screen sizes
