As a part of a new series, I'll try to piece together my recent readings and findings. Some of which are pieces that I've heard brillient people talking that makes me reflect deeper into myself. I'll post them here, for my personal reminder, also for your encouragement.

Need to mention, some or most of them are just opinions, not facts. There's no certain path to follow, if it does exist, follow what leads your heart.


## Keep the momentum.
This was brought up in a social event after weeks of exams. By context, it refers to the fact that one shouldn't let go of the state of mental fulfillness and keep things undergoing. Personally, I think it's also about building a life cycle with consistent dedication to tasks and focus that runs automatically. Conversively, eating cold served food, may not be a good ieda.

## Two way doors.
It's one of Amazon's Leadership Principles that some of us shared concensus. It basically refers a situation where one's stuck with the decision whether to move forward and being indecisive. By two way doors, it means always trying the other option when there is. If it fails, just naturally falls back to where one left off. 

I recalled this not because it's anything new, but mostly as a reminder for myself that I should at least try options before landing myself in any position, comfortable or not. And that this idea of evolution should be embedded in our daily process.

## Keep chasing novelty with performance
The thing is it's way easier to get stuck in a field, only worrying about what's happening around. One can be a excellent fish hunter after generations of hunting in the north Atalantic, yet he's never had any experience of riding camels in a desert. Life is not just about persuing absolute excellence in one area, but also in the joy of discovering diverse experience in the vast world. Trying new combinations may somehow lead to unexpected results.

Nolvelty is a sense of interestingness increment. Go explore the unknown part of the chart my friend.



To conclude, there're some pictures taken recently at the Seven Sisters Cliff. Nicely weather, calming views, friendly neighbourhood, curious seegulls (trying to share our fish & chips). If anyone's interested in going to Briton, you should try this place named Pinocchio, they've got the best Italian food(Personally).
