### A Brief Intro

I have been longing for this blog for quite some time. It is not until the emergence of AI tools and some undertaken software development experience that makes this possible.

Sometimes you will have this feeling that some ideas have to get out, whether it's in the shower or some small talks with friends, and it is quite a pity that without recording, they're very easy to flee away. 

In the days to come, I will keep updating this blog with my best ability, to capture these ideas. Hopefully, my readers, you can find this journey worthwhile.

You're always welcome to drop me an [email](mailto:wang.jiankai@outlook.com).


### About the Main Page Images
The moss picture was taken on my last journey to Saihoji Garden in August 2024. It was a secret trip meant to get away from the normal life. All efforts paid off when reaching the temple. The tranquility and zen are beyond words.

You see the nature, you see the nurturance, you see momentum.

You discover deeper in yourself.
